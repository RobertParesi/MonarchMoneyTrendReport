# Monarch Money Tweaks - GET STARTED! 

[Already have MM Tweaks? - Click here to Update to V2.41](https://github.com/RobertParesi/MonarchMoneyTrendReport/raw/refs/heads/main/MonarchMoneyTweaks.user.js)

Hello!  I use **Monarch Money**.  

I found there were opportunities to enhance the Monarch Money web application with more functionality and configuration options.

# Features:

* **Reports / Trends**
    - Summarize your Monarch Money history.
    - Compare to: Last month, Same month last year, Same quarter last year.
    - Display a monthly grid of your history for: This year, Last year, Last 12 months, All years (including YTD totals and monthly/yearly averages)
    - Customize comparisons and averages to include the current month if desired.
    - Highlight spending based on thresholds: 25%, 50%, 100%
    - Drill down to view monthly and year-to-date totals to identify trends in your groups and categories.
    - Sort history data by any column and export it to Excel or Numbers.

* **Reports / Accounts**
     - Summarize all your Account balances on one screen
     - Compare to different time periods (This week, Last two weeks, This month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years)
     - Show Monthly Account balances with average for current year, last 6 months or last 12 months
     - Quickly view total amount owed on credit cards and other Checking and Credit card balances
     - View Income, Expenses and Transfers done by Account for the current month
     - Filter Accounts by a custom Group (e.g., "Parents, Children" or "Partner 1, Partner 2, Both" or "Taxable, Tax Deferred" etc).
     - Sort accounts data by any column and export it to Excel or Numbers.

## Contributions:

This GitHub repository is currently not set up for contributions, but I welcome your ideas and feedback. Please feel free to reach out via private message or email to discuss any thoughts you may have.

One important guideline for this extension is that it will not include any features that add, change, or delete records in Monarch. This decision is made to maintain a high level of trust and confidence in the extension's use, ensuring that it does not impact anyone's data. Thank you for your understanding!
