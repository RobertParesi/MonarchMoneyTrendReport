# Issue with Trends/Accounts

I am aware that the **Trends & Accounts** reports are not firing.  It seems that Monarch has changed the URL and their Reports menu structure, but breaks my hack so I can insert my reports into their sub-menu.  I'm 90% there with a resolution (actually it will be smoother & nicer) but there is a small part I'm trying to resolve to put out a fix.  Please give me a day to finish resolving it and I'll get out an update.

Thank you for your patience!

Hello!  I use **Monarch Money**.  

I found there were opportunities to enhance the Monarch Money web application with more functionality and configuration options.

# FEATURES:

* **Reports / Trends**
    - Summarize your Monarch Money history comparing to Last month, Same month last year or Same quarter last year
    - Display a monthly grid of your history for This Year, Last Year, Last 12 months or All Years including YTD totals and Monthly/Yearly average
    - Customize if you want the comparison and averages to include the current month
    - Different highlights for spending > 25%, > 50% and > 100%
    - Drill down to monthly and year-to-date totals to see trends for your groups & categories
    - Sort the data by any column and export your data to Excel or Numbers

* **Reports / Accounts**
     - Summarize all your Account balances on one screen
     - Compare to different time periods (This week, Last two weeks, This month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years)
     - Show Monthly Account balances with average for current year, last 6 months or last 12 months
     - Quickly see total amount owed on credit cards and other Checking and Credit card balances
     - See Income, Expenses and Transfers done by Account for the current month
     - Sort the data by any column and export your data to Excel or Numbers
