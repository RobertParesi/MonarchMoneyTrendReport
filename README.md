# Monarch Money Tweaks

Hello!  I use **Monarch Money**.  

I found there were opportunities to enhance the Monarch Money web application with more functionality and configuration options. You can install the script on the iPad using **Safari </> Userscripts** app or using the **Tampermonkey** app extension on Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Firefox and Opera Next.  


Non iPad users: Install Tampermonkey by going to the following link:  https://www.tampermonkey.net/

iPad users: Close your Safari browser, go to App Store and install the Userscripts (User Script and Style Manager) by Justin Wasack.



Once the above is installed, you can install or update the Monarch Money Tweaks extension by clicking on the following link:

https://github.com/RobertParesi/MonarchMoneyTrendReport/raw/refs/heads/main/MonarchMoneyTweaks.user.js



Finally, Refresh/Reload the Monarch Money webpage and select **Settings / Display** in Monarch to configure the Tweaks.

Please read each option carefully before turning it on/off to fully understand what it does. 

Enjoy!
