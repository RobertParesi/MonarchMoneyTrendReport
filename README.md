Hello!

I use **Monarch Money**.  

I found there were opportunities to enhance the Monarch Money web application with more functionality and configuration options using Javascript and Tampermonkey.   All you need to do is add the **Tampermonkey** browser extension.  Tampermonkey is a browser extension for Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera Next, and Firefox.  Simply make sure it is installed by going to "Extensions" in your web browser.

https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Once Tampermonkey is installed, you can next click on **Update MonarchMoneyTweaks.user.js** above and it will automatically install.

# Monarch Money Tweaks

* Ability to Save and Restore Report Datasets (Save all settings on Reports page)
  
* Ability to turn ON/OFF menu items.

* Ability to hide Report Tooltip Difference 

* Ability to Hide Create Rule Tooltip



There is also a second optional extension which recreates a Mint Trends report, allowing you to compare two periods inside the Sankey report.

# Monarch Money Trend Report
Trend Report (Compare This Period/Last Period) for Monarch Money

The Trend Report is used to simply pace Total Savings comparing where you ae at one period to where you were another period (ie: same time, last year).

To use - On the Reports / Sankey Diagram:

1. Run the Sankey Diagram for a Compare Period you want ("Last Year" or say "1/1/2023 to 3/31/2023") and then press Trend Compare
2. Run the Sankey Diagram again for a new/current period you want ("This Year") and press Trend Report

That's it.

**Figures in GREEN are Good!   You made more, Green.  You spent less, Green.  You saved more, Green.**

Things I've learned along the way:

"BOTH" Sankey does not work - only use Categories & Groups. I have not worked on it at all to work for "BOTH"

The information is pulled not from a Query (graphql) and is really screen scraped - so it's really their data, just reformatted with some small tweaks. 

I welcome any comments.

Enjoy!
