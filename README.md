Hello!

I use **Monarch Money**.  

I found there were opportunities to enhance the Monarch Money web application with more functionality and configuration options using Tampermonkey.  Tampermonkey is a browser extension for Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera Next, and Firefox.  You can install it by going to the following link.

https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Once Tampermonkey is installed, you can next click on **Update MonarchMoneyTweaks.user.js** above and it will automatically install.
