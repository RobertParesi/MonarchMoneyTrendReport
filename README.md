# Monarch Money Tweaks

Hello!

I use **Monarch Money**.  

I found there were opportunities to enhance the Monarch Money web application with more functionality and configuration options using Tampermonkey.  Tampermonkey is a browser extension for Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera Next, and Firefox.  

You can install it by going to the following link: 

https://www.tampermonkey.net/


Once Tampermonkey is installed, install the Monarch Money Tweaks extension:

https://github.com/RobertParesi/MonarchMoneyTrendReport/raw/refs/heads/main/MonarchMoneyTweaks.user.js


Finally, Refresh/Reload the Monarch Money webpage and select **Settings / Display** in Monarch to configure the Tweaks.

Please read each option carefully before turning it on/off to fully understand what it does.

Enjoy!
