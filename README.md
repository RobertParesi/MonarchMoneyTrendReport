# Monarch Money Tweaks - GET STARTED!

Hello!  I use **Monarch Money**.  

I found there were opportunities to enhance the Monarch Money web application with more functionality and configuration options.

# FEATURES:

* **Reports / Trends** - Summarize your Monarch Money history comparing to Last month, Same month last year or Same quarter last year.  Display a monthly grid of your history for This Year, Last Year or Last 12 months including YTD totals and Monthly average. Customize if you want the comparison and averages to include the current month.  Drill down to monthly and year-to-date totals to see trends for your groups & categories. Sort the data by any column and export your data to Excel or Numbers.

* **Reports / Accounts** - Summarize all your Account balances on one screen with sorting and exporting.  Compare to different time periods (This week, Last two weeks, This month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years)

* Breadcrumbs on **Reports / Income & Spending** allows staying on Reports page instead of going to Transactions connecting _All Categories > Groups > Categories_ 

* Save and restore your Report filters and other report options on **Reports / Datasets**

* Compressed & Smaller Transactions grid to show more items

* Compressed & Smaller **Budget / Forecast** grid to show more items
  
* Turn ON/OFF (hide) menu items

* Hide Report Tooltip "Difference Amount" in graphs

* Hide Create Rule Popup when add/changing transactions

* Quickly split a transaction 50/50 by auto-filling the amounts

* Correct Calendar Year pull-down to only be years of data instead of since 2000

* Added "Last year YTD", "Last 12 months" and "This quarter" to pop-up calendar

* Hide Accounts Net Worth Graph Panel

* Show Pending Transactions in Red when **Settings / Preferences / Allow Edits to Pending Transactions** is set to "Off".
