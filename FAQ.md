## About Monarch Money Tweaks Extension
> Safety, Security and Transparency of this extension:

**Monarch Money Tweaks** is a 100% raw JavaScript program and open-source.   

Anyone with coding knowledge can easily read and understand this extension’s functionality. It utilizes the Monarch Money GraphQL API, which is integral to the Monarch Money ecosystem. 

This extension is built without any dependencies or external libraries—aside from Tampermonkey—ensuring maximum transparency and security. The Monarch Money GraphQL API is developed by Monarch Money and is utilized in their mobile framework, report graphs, and more.

The connection utilizes the same security token stored by Monarch Money, ensuring no data is collected or transmitted outside of this connection. 

Tampermonkey is an open-source script extension used by over 11 million users, compatible with most browsers, and adheres to the same security standards required by Microsoft and Safari for their extensions. 

This extension is exclusively available on GitHub, which is a reputable source hub used by more than 20 million users and secured with Two-Factor Authentication. 

Having been available for over a year to members of the Monarch Money community, I welcome any questions, concerns, or requests for assistance. Please do not hesitate to email me at robert@paresi.net.
